## üöÄ My Professional Journey & Key Achievements

While my public GitHub will soon feature personal projects and open-source contributions, my professional journey has been rich with impactful work at innovative companies. Here are some highlights of my experience:

### Senior Frontend Software Engineer @ Flo Recruit (July 2021 - May 2025)
As the company's first dedicated Frontend Engineer, I played a pivotal role in shaping their modern web presence:
*   **Architected & Led V2 Platform:** Spearheaded the architecture and was the primary implementer for the company's flagship V2 Applicant Tracking System (ATS) using Next.js, TypeScript, and GraphQL. I led this from initial concept (Oct 2021) through public launch (Sept 2022) and subsequent feature expansions.
*   **Pioneered Design System Adoption:** Proactively formalized and drove the adoption of the company's first Design System (Radix UI, TailwindCSS, Storybook) nearly a year before our first in-house designer, significantly improving UI consistency and development velocity.
*   **Established Frontend Excellence:** Defined core frontend architecture, coding standards, and best practices. I served as the primary frontend resource and mentor, onboarding and leveling up multiple full-stack engineers.
*   **Solved Complex UI/UX Challenges:** Engineered highly performant solutions for large-scale data display (e.g., virtualized tables, complex filtering), designed intricate accessible user interactions (e.g., multi-step wizards, precise drag-and-drop components), and resolved architectural bottlenecks.
*   **Enhanced Developer Experience:** Introduced and configured TanStack (React) Query with OpenAPI/GraphQL code generation, streamlining data fetching and state management.
*   **Collaborated on Full-Stack Solutions:** Advised on API design (GraphQL schema) and data modeling in close collaboration with backend teams.

### Software Developer / Consultant @ Expero Inc (July 2016 - July 2021)
I delivered custom software solutions for enterprise clients, specializing in interactive and data-intensive frontend applications:
*   **US Treasury Bond Trading Platform (React, D3.js, OpenFin):** Core contributor on a multi-year project for a platform facilitating billions in daily trading volume. My work included implementing complex UI features, enhancing D3.js data visualizations, developing an offline-first demo capability, improving rendering performance with a bespoke virtualized grid, and managing OpenFin desktop integration.
*   **Internal Risk Analysis Toolkit (React, TypeScript, Visx, D3, MapboxGL):** Key developer for an internal toolkit, where I implemented interactive visualizations (Map, Network Diagram, Timeline), developed a custom animated canvas layer, and engineered its foundational frontend architecture.
*   **Pharmaceutical & Science Platforms (React, ElectronJS, VueJS):** Rapidly prototyped and developed specialized UIs, including a supply-chain planning tool with Sankey and Time Series visualizations (React, D3, ElectronJS), and contributed to modernizing a laboratory management frontend from Backbone/jQuery to VueJS.
*   **Commercial Real Estate Mobile App (React Native):** Built, tested, and deployed a tenant experience mobile application (iOS/Android), ensuring design fidelity and setting up automated testing with Jest.
*   **Community Leadership:** Co-founded and managed the company mentorship program & podcast, and led a tech-focused special interest group.

### Software Developer @ Tiltfactor Lab (Dartmouth College) (Sept 2014 - June 2016)
*   Developed engaging web-based games for social impact using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and PhaserJS, supported by Node.js/MongoDB REST APIs and a Go/WebSockets real-time multiplayer prototype.
